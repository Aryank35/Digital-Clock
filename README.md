# Digital-Clock
 A simple digital clock web application implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock displays the current time and date, with separate divs for hours, minutes, seconds, and a date display. The clock updates in real-time every second. This repository serves as a reference for creating and styling a basic digital clock on a webpage.
